# SharpPath
SharpPath is  a GameMaker Studio extension that provides asynchronous, grid-based pathfinding for GMS.  Essentially, it processes the pathfinding algorithm asynchronously, which can potentially boost performance (in relation to GameMaker native pathfinding mechanisms), specially in situations with large maps or many concurrent executions (like when many enemies are chasing the player).

This repository contains the DLL code, the extension files as well as a GMS example project with basic functionalities. Documentation is a work in progress but some of it can be found in /docs.
